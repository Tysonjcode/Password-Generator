# Password-Generator
UWA Bootcamp javescript Password Generator project

In this project, I had to create a password generator that randomly creates a password from a set of chosen factors by the user. You must click the red "Generate Password" button to start the function which will then ask you to choose between 8 and 128 or it will send you back to the start. next, it will ask the user to select from choices of "upper case" "lower case" "numbers" and "special characters". This will return back to the start after a prompt if none of the choices were chosen, as long as 1 was at least chosen it will display a randomly generated password from the user's choices.
